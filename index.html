            C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in
            1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming
            language. It is an object-oriented language, which means it allows
            programmers to define data types in the form of classes and objects,
            and to create and manipulate those objects using methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            C++ is a statically typed language, which means that variables must
            be declared with a specific data type before they can be used. It is
            also a compiled language, which means that source code written in
            C++ must be converted into machine code (a series of instructions
            that can be executed by a computer's processor) before it can be
            run.

              C++ is an object-oriented programming language that is an
              extension of the C programming language. C is a procedural
              programming language, which means that it focuses on a sequence of
              actions that are executed one after the other. C++ adds support
              for object-oriented programming, which involves organizing code
              into classes and objects that can interact with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the main differences between C and C++ is that C++ supports
              object-oriented programming, while C does not. C++ also has
              additional features such as function overloading, templates, and
              exception handling, which are not present in C.
            </p>
            <p>
              C++ is a more powerful and flexible language than C, and it is
              often used for building large, complex software systems. However,
              C is still widely used because it is a simple and efficient
              language, and it is easy to learn. C++ is often used in situations
              where the programmer needs more control over the program and the
              hardware, such as in systems programming or low-level programming.

                  In C++, a variable is a named location in memory that is used
                  to store a value. When you declare a variable, you specify its
                  type and name, and you can then use the variable to store and
                  manipulate data in your program.

                  There are several ways to declare variables in C++. The most
                  basic way is to simply specify the data type and the name of
                  the variable:
                </p>
                <p>With the keyword int. For example,</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>int x = 42.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Once a variable is declared, you can use it to store and
                  manipulate data in your program. For example, you can assign a
                  new value to the variable, or you can use it in an expression:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>x = 30; // Assign a new value to the variable "x"</li>
                  <li>
                    int newX = x + 5; // Use the variable "x" in an expression
                    to calculate a new value
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  In C++, the scope of a variable refers to the region of the
                  program in which the variable is visible or can be accessed. A
                  variable's scope determines where it can be used in the
                  program and how long it will exist in memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are two main types of variable scope in C++: local scope
                  and global scope.

                <p>
                  a global variable is a variable that is defined outside of any
                  block of code, such as a function or loop, and is therefore
                  visible and accessible throughout the entire program. Global
                  variables are created when the program starts and are
                  destroyed when the program ends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Global variables are useful in situations where you need to
                  share data between different parts of your program, such as
                  between functions or across multiple source files. However,
                  they can also introduce complexity and can make it more
                  difficult to understand the behavior of your code, especially
                  if they are used extensively.

                  A constant is a value that cannot be modified once it has been
                  set. Constants are often used to define values that are used
                  frequently throughout a program and that should not be changed
                  by accident.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are several ways to define constants in C++. One way is
                  to use the "const" keyword to define a constant variable:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    const int MAX_ITEMS = 100; // Define a constant called
                    "MAX_ITEMS" with the value 100
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Another way to define constants in C++ is to use the "define"
                  directive:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    #define MAX_ITEMS 100 // Define a constant called
                    "MAX_ITEMS" with the value 100
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  It's important to use constants to define values that should
                  not be changed, as it helps to make your code more
                  maintainable and less prone to errors. Constants also make
                  your code more readable, as they provide a meaningful name for
                  the value rather than just using a hard-coded number.

                <p>
                  there are several different data types that you can use to
                  declare variables. The most basic data types are the built-in
                  types, which include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Integer types: "int", "short", "long", and "long long"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Floating-point types: "float", "double", and "long double"
                  </li>
                  <li>Boolean type: "bool"</li>
                  <li>Character type: "char"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  In addition to the built-in types, C++ also allows you to
                  define your own custom data types using user-defined types,
                  such as "struct" (structure) and "class" (class). These types
                  allow you to create complex data structures and objects that
                  can represent real-world entities in your program.

              <code>
                <p>
                  In C++, the "if-else" statement is a control flow statement
                  that allows you to execute a block of code conditionally based
                  on the value of a Boolean expression. The Boolean expression
                  is evaluated, and if it is found to be true, the code in the
                  "if" block is executed. If the Boolean expression is false,
                  the code in the "else" block is executed instead.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  You may also compound the statements using else if to have
                  multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
                  </li>
                  <li>statement_last; }</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical
                  condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute
                  multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({
                  ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block
                  statements, especially when nesting if statements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                  </li>
                  <li>statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {</li>
                  <li>statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;</li>
                  <li>statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</li>

                  the "while" statement is a control flow statement that allows
                  you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given
                  condition is true. The "while" statement continuously
                  evaluates a Boolean expression and, if the expression is found
                  to be true, it executes the code in the loop body. The loop
                  continues to execute until the Boolean expression is false.

                  The "while" loop is a useful tool for executing a block of

                  advance how many times the loop will need to execute. It is
                  important to ensure that the Boolean expression used in the
                  "while" loop eventually becomes false, or the loop will
                  execute indefinitely and your program will become stuck in an
                  infinite loop.

                  A function definition (also called a function declaration, or
                  function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed
                  by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The name of the function.</li>
                  <li>
                    A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses
                    and separated by commas.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The C++ statements that define the function, enclosed in
                    curly brackets, { }.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  For example, the following code defines a simple function
                  named add:
                </p>
                <ul class="FDUL">
                  <li>int add(int x, int y) {</li>
                  <li>return x + y; // Return the sum of "x" and "y"</li>
                  <li>}</li>
                </ul>
